# Backbone app skeleton

Just clone this repo and use it as a starting point for your new Backbone.js based voyages.

## Assumptions

Skeletons like these can work well only if there are certain assumptions/conventions.

1. We assume that you use **CoffeeScript** for all your scripting.
2. We assume that you use **SASS** for your styling.
3. We assume that you use **HAML** for your base DOM.
4. We assume that you use **HAML(c)** for your templates for Backbone views.

## What gives

It provides:

- directory structure
- compilation to native JS/CSS/HTML via Guard
- self contained Ruby web server through Sinatra
